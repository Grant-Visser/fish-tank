Binary Number Systems
These have been explored and should be revised
Bitmasking
Using Bits to convey a larger overall set of information 
Const int Citizen = 1; //001
Const int Employed = 2 //010
Const int Enfranchised = 4//100

Int Person 0 = 0 | Citizen | Enfranchised; //101

Multiple if statements and checks in a single variable.

C++ memory allocation
•	Globally allocated memory
•	Automatically allocated memory
•	Dynamic/Heap allocated memory
o	New allocates memory for a new variable.
o	New[] contiguous block of information.
o	New() Allocates memory at a specific location.
o	New()[] new contiguous block at a specific location.
o	Delete Returns for a single variable.
o	Delete[] gives black a contiguous block of memory.
o	NULL = Memory Address 0. (investigate NULLPTR)
Addresses Pointers and integers
Pointers
•	Int* a; //a is a pointer
•	Int* b,c; //Only b will be a pointer
•	Int *x,*z,*y ; //All are pointers
Addresses 
•	Address-of operator = &
•	Int a = 1337
•	Int*ptr_a = &a; // ptr_a = Memory address of a
 
Example
•	Int* ptr_a = NULL;
•	Ptr_a = new int;
•	*ptr_a = 1337;
•	Cout << *ptr_a;
•	Delete ptr_a;
•	Ptr_a = NULL;
Arrays
•	Multidimensional Arrays
•	Static array
•	S
•	Array[index] == *(index + array)
Pointer Scaling
Using a pointer to loop through an array as long as you know when to stop.
Char* ptr=&aryOdds[0];
While(ptr != ‘\0’)
Cout << aryOdds[]
Parameter Passing const parameters
Void Bar (Const int &ptr)
Function Pointer
Double * (*m) (int)
